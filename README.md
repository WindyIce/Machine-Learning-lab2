The lab2 of machine learning.


The time cost of Regression is a bit long. Because each turn I use the whole matrix to compute the gradient which has shape bigger than (20000,100). Maybe fixed in the future. But you can still see the result directly in the jupyter notebook.

And the Classification also!
